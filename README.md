# Archived Repository

**Wololol** or **Lol Web Client** tried to be a League of Legends client on a
responsive web page. It included summoner profile information such as league,
match history, runes, masteries, server status, etc through the Riot API. It
would have all the store items and prices. And it was the first to include chat
capabilities with a custom xmpp client.

It is made with django, requests, xmpp, materialize css, and love.

We were learning at the time, it has everything but best practices, but it was a
fun project. Feel free to study and use the code and the chat libraries for
whatever you want.

*By the time this gif was captured the Riot API version we were using had been
deprecated a long time ago, thus many features are not shown.*
